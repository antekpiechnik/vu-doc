\section{Sources of user activity data on the Social Web}

In order to answer the first research question, we have focused on data from two social services: \textit{YouTube} and
\textit{Twitter}. The goal of this chapter is to present the organization of the \textit{User Activity Data} available
in those two networks. In the first subsection we describe user data available via APIs for
\textit{YouTube}, whereas the following section covers possible methods of extracting preference information from \textit{Twitter} users' timelines.
\subsection{YouTube}
YouTube stores various data concerning its users and content. Tables
1 - 5 show the types of information
available. The table caption names entity, that the field names refer to, the
column \textit{access} describes in what way these values can be obtained.
Within this data, three sets are of particular use for user
profiling. These sets are: \emph{favorites}, \emph{subscriptions} and
\emph{uploads}. These sets were chosen because they have two features in common: they all are connected
to user's interests and a user needs to perform an action (\eg click a button on the site)
in order to add an item to the set. These features make them particularily useful for user profiling.
For this reason, the rest of YouTube research in this paper will focus on these three sets.
In order to find out how frequently the
mentioned sets are used, a sample of 7,500 randomly chosen users was examined,
as described in section 3.1.1.

\textit{YouTube} also contains multiple demographic data.

\subsubsection{YouTube usage}

Measuring popularity of the three YouTube sets -- favourites,
subscriptions and uploads. From the 7,500 users analyzed, notable differences in activity
where noted. Many users show little activity, as compared to a few highly active users.
50\% analyzed accounts had less than 60 favourites, 6000(!) out of 7,500 had less than 40 uploads.
All histograms on Figure 1 show numbers of users
(axis y) with $x_1-x_3$ numbers of favourites/subscriptions/uploads. For all
three cases, almost all users belonged to the first histogram range -- the one
with least items. As number of items grows, the number of users decreases so
quickly, that logarithmic scale has been used in order to increase the readability of the
charts.

For all three sets, almost half of examined users had no more than 100 items.
This means that for most cases, the user profiling would need to be based on a very
scarse amount of data.

  groups.}

\subsubsection{YouTube video descriptions corpus}

A corpus of titles and descriptions for little over 100,000 videos was collected
for text-based analysis of YouTube data. The file's size was 36 Mbytes. This
data was used to compute number of video descriptions with identifiable concepts from
\textit{Freebase}\footnote{http://freebase.com} data vocabularies (more on this in section 4).

\subsection{Twitter}

Data available on \textit{Twitter} is composed of natural language short messages posted by users
consisting of up to 140 characters, commonly known as \textbf{tweets}. Within
those tweets we can distinguish user mentions (\textit{Twitter} usernames preceeded with the symbol @,
such as \textit{@justinbieber} -- accessible via \textit{Twitter}\footnote{http://twitter.com/justinbieber}) as well as topics in form of \textit{hashtags} -- name stripped of all whitespace
and preceded by the hash symbol, \eg \textit{\#TheDailyShow} \cite{edinburg-corpus}.

The initial purpose of tweets was to inform other users of currently performed activities. However, as this service has
evolved, users started to use \textit{tweets} for a variety of purposes, such as conversations,
sharing information/URLs and reporting news \cite{why-we-twitter, twitter-content-is-it}. In this section we describe available methods to use such unstructured data. We will use the expression \textit{named entity} (NE) to refer to
known media people, shows and programmes.
In our experiments we focus on the following NE extraction methods:

\paragraph{Mentioning entities names}
Using simple string matching methods, we search for NE names within \textit{Twitter} users' streams and updates.
Occurrences of NE names in the stream indicate interest in the NE mentioned. The
number of references is expected to be positively correlated with the level of interest in the given NE \cite{twitter-content-is-it}.
Entities might be mentioned by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{full name} (\eg \textit{"Having a How I Met Your Mother marathon."})
  \item \textit{hashtag} (\eg \textit{"Who?! Where? I love \#HowIMetYourMother!"})
  \item \textit{twitter username} (entity's twitter username, if known, \eg \textit{"@HIMYM\_CBS It entertains the spirit"})
  \item \textit{acronyms} (\eg \textit{"Watching HIMYM. Season 3."})
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Usage of preference vocabulary when tweeting about entities}
In order to extract preference towards a NE from a tweet, vocabularies that express
preference was prepared. They have been pragmatically chosen by looking at random tweets.
This vocabulary contains the following words: \textit{like, recommend, liked, love, great,
awesome, enjoyed, stunning, loving, good, hate, bad, worst, poor}.
Those verbs were searched for in the tweets containing entity mentions.
Example of a tweet: \textit{"yesterday's \#Lost episode was stunning!"}
\paragraph{Usage of activity verbs when tweeting about entities}
When mentioning a media-related NE, users may also describe the activity performed.
In order to find such tweets, an activity verbs vocabulary hasbeen prepared (similarly to
the preference verbs, it was chosen by looking at the contents of random tweets).
This vocabulary contains the followings verbs: \textit{watching, watched, play,
watch, playing, saw, seen, played}.
Describing the activity of participating in a certain TV experience (such
as watching a show) has to be noted due to the fact that Twitter users are more
likely to specify what they are doing at a particular moment.
Example of a tweet: \textit{"Finnally watched Ironman 2 aha'"}

\paragraph{Extracting entities from structured twitter stream sources}
Applications, such as \textit{YouTube} or \textit{Boxee}\footnote{http://www.boxee.tv}, automatically generate tweets
if the user linked their Twitter account with that application. These tweets are
usually well structured, and therefore very suitable to extract a NE, activity or preference.
Examples of tweets: (\textit{Boxee}) -- \textit{"likes Inglourious Basterds on Boxee http://bit.ly/FbAbn"} and
\textit{YouTube} -- \textit{"I liked a YouTube video -- How I Met Your Mother - Lorenzo Van Matterhorn"}

\paragraph{Summary}
We present the possible measurements for extracting the UAD from \textit{Twitter} in Table 6:

\subsubsection{Corpus used for research}

The example data analyzed consists of Twitter streams consisting in total of about 42,000 tweets of
203 different users. They have been selected by looking at the followers of popular TV
channels and broadcasters available on Twitter. Users were selected based on the number
of tweets and their followers. For our experiments, we have focused on tweets in English.

The most significant reason for using a precompiled corpus for this research is the Twitter API Rate Limiting
which makes a wider analysis challenging. Furthermore, a great deal of Twitter users provide data not necessarily
useful for our experiments. All non-English mentions may be located,
but make extracting preference information more challenging. Using a preselected corpus enables measuring and comparing the effectiveness of different counting methods much easier \cite{short-tweet}.

\subsection{Metrics used in constructing User Profile}

The generated user profile is a collection of concepts along with their
weights. In order to keep the scale of the weight simple (more on that in the
''User evaluation'' section), we limited the scale to an integer range from 0
up to 3, meaning accordingly: ''do not like'', ''neutral'', ''like'', ''like
very much''. In order to determine the weight for each concepts, simple metrics
were used: number of repeats normalized to the mostly repeated item for
YouTube, and XXX for Twitter.
