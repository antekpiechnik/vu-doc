\maketitle

\begin{abstract} Social networks have been becoming hugely popular over the last
years. With enormous number of people sharing information about their lives,
they are now a great source of information about their interests. Based on both
structured data (such as the social aspect of YouTube) as well as unstructured
(Twitter), we will be trying to find out how accurately we can profile user's
preferences for it to be usable in a real life project (NoTube).

\subsection{Technologies used in Twitter research}
\subsubsection{Language}
Most processing has been done using the \textit{Ruby} language. The NoTube tubelets/reasonlets will be implemented in either pure \textit{Java} or \textit{JRuby}.
\subsubsection{Tools}
Twitter API requests are been handled via the OAuth protocol and provided in a JSON-based stream form. Only the newest tweets for the pre-selected Twitter usernames are downloaded. The entities definitions and semantics are provided by the FreeBase database REST interface. All the processing occurs locally on the pre-loaded Twitter data. \\ Ruby gems used include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{bdb} from mattbauer - a BerkeleyDB wrapper for Ruby
  \item \textit{twitter} from jnunemaker - a wrapper around the Twitter API
  \item \textit{ferret} - full text search engine written in Ruby
  \item \textit{ken} from michael-aufreiter - wrapper for the freebase.org API
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Storage}
Due to Twitter API request rate limiting, tweets have been aggregated in a local
\textit{Berkeley DB} database instance providing a fast and easy key-value
information retrieval. Since great amount of data needs to be processed, a full
text search engine has been used, which greatly increased the searching time. In
this case, we decided on using \textit{ferret} - a Ruby implementation of a
full-text search engine (similar to Apache's \textit{Lucene}).
