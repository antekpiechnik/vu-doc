\maketitle

\begin{abstract} Social networks have been becoming hugely popular over the last
years. With enormous number of people sharing information about their lives,
they are now a great source of information about their interests. Based on both
structured data (such as the social aspect of YouTube) as well as unstructured
(Twitter), we will be trying to find out how accurately we can profile user's
preferences for it to be usable in a real life project (NoTube).
