% See p.105 of "TeX Unbound" for suggested values.
% See pp. 199-200 of Lamport's "LaTeX" book for details.
%   General parameters, for ALL pages:
\renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.9}	% max fraction of floats at top
\renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.8}	% max fraction of floats at bottom
%   Parameters for TEXT pages (not float pages):
\setcounter{topnumber}{2}
\setcounter{bottomnumber}{2}
\setcounter{totalnumber}{4}     % 2 may work better
\setcounter{dbltopnumber}{2}    % for 2-column pages
\renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{0.9}	% fit big float above 2-col. text
\renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.07}	% allow minimal text w. figs
%   Parameters for FLOAT pages (not text pages):
\renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.7}	% require fuller float pages
% N.B.: floatpagefraction MUST be less than topfraction !!
\renewcommand{\dblfloatpagefraction}{0.7}	% require fuller float pages

\title{\textbf{Profiling users media preferences based on social network data streams}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract} Social networks have been becoming hugely popular over the last
years. With enormous number of people sharing information about their lives,
they are now a great source of information about their media interests. Based on both
structured data (such as the social aspect of \textit{YouTube}\footnote{http://www.youtube.com}) as well as unstructured
(\textit{Twitter}\footnote{http://www.twitter.com}), we analyze what data can be extracted from their profiles as well as
how useful such extraction is for profiling those users. This profiling could
prove hugely influential for media-oriented recommender systems, such as the one
used in the \textit{NoTube}\footnote{http://www.notube.tv} project.
We focus on aggregating and analyzing the publicly available data and covering
different approaches of profile generation
for users. Our experiments reveal multiple ways of employing social networks'
data for users profiling as well as show promising results for employing
this data in a real-life project.
