\section{Introduction}

Recommender systems used to involve recommending more physical objects \cite{combining-cf-with-pa} to users.
However, more and more abstract topics are becoming parts of such recommenders (such as tags) \cite{accuracy-recommending}. The NoTube project bases its recommendation of TV programmes on aggregating,
extracting and analyzing user activities \cite{notube-main}.

On the Web, a great deal of \textit{user activity data} can be found on several networks. This UAD (\textit{user activity data}) varies from user video viewing history and subscriptions to video channels (\eg \textit{YouTube}) to users' activity updates formed in natural language (such as \textit{Twitter}) \cite{why-we-twitter}.

In this paper we experiment on those data streams and evaluate their usefulness to the user profile generation. We answer
two main research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What user data can we collect from \textit{structured} and \textit{unstructured} user activity streams?
  \item How useful is \textit{structured} UAD as compared to \textit{unstructured} UAD, to generate a user profile?
\end{enumerate}

By the \textit{structured} user activity data, we understand data organized in predefined
preference groups (such as favorites, subscriptions, etc. on \textit{YouTube}).
We define \textit{unstructured} UAD, on the other hand, as data expressed in natural language
(user streams on \textit{Twitter}).

To answer the first research question, we focus on analyzing the
data and the way people use services like \textit{YouTube} and \textit{Twitter} to share
their media preferences.

We answer the second research question with a comparative analysis of the available data and
methods for generating user profile for both services.
Our research reveals that more complex methods are required when processing \textit{unstructured} UAD.
We have also observed that there are differences in user profiling data as well as its
accuracy. However, despite those differences, both of them may provide
enough opportunities for user media preference extraction.

In the following section we describe related work on the subject. In section 3, we describe
a selection of sources of user activities on the Social Web. Section 4 contains the description of
the vocabulary we employed in our experiments. We follow by detailing the results of our experiments
with the usage of \textit{structured} (section 5) and \textit{unstructured} (section 6) user activity data.
The next part of the paper (section 7) is a comparison of the usage of both kinds of UAD. Section 8
details the user evaluation of generated profiles. We conclude with a section on future
work, a summary (section 9) and our implementation details (section 10).

\section{Related work}

A considerable number of papers examining social Web services have been
published. Works devoted to YouTube often contain analysis of the video data
stored by the service and its implications to the traffic generated
(\cite{i-tube-you-tube}, \cite{views-from-the-edge},
\cite{statistics-and-social-network}), some study impact of YouTube service on
very narrow topics, like 2006 USA presidential elections
\cite{voters-myspace-youtube}, or social attitude towards vaccinacions
\cite{keelan}. There are also papers analyzing privacy issues of using YouTube
\cite{publicly-private}.

Works analyzing \textit{Twitter} as a data stream can differ from very general \cite{why-we-twitter},
to works devoted to analyzing content of the \textit{Twitter} users' timelines (such as \cite{twitter-content-is-it} and \cite{short-tweet}).

There are also works devoted to automated user profile generation, covering multiple data sources for profile
information aggregation \cite{public-profiles}, as well as abusing social networks for profile generation \cite{twitter-abuse}. Apart from profile generation, a URL recommender system for \textit{Twitter} users
has been introduced by \cite{short-tweet}.

The works describing user profiling in general are focused on finding the basic user profile ontology \cite{creating-ontology-for-user-profile}, and their role in recommender systems area \cite{ontological-user-profiling}.

Apart from the papers mentioned, we have also found various implementations of systems that aggregate personal preferences based on different
social services:

\paragraph{Hunch}
\textit{Hunch}\footnote{http://www.hunch.com} is a service offering recommendations on different topics based on a user's
\textit{Twitter} data. It is able to employ methods of graph reasoning for users followers and following lists
in order to predict his answers to various questions. In addition to that, it is able to recommend products
to users and provide them with links to online stores containing those products.
Initial prediction results and their accuracy suggest that
\textit{Twitter} users data does contain information about their preferences. \textit{Hunch} is a \textit{gray box}
--  it does not provide information on how the recommender system works, but it provides a rich
API for accessing its data
