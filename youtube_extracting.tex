\section{Extracting user profile from YouTube}

Our goal is to extract a user profile. For this paper, we will assume that user's
profile is a collection of linked data concepts, that should be understood as
user's interests. Many YouTube's videos have very semantic meaning -- they can
be associated with existing concepts (like actors or music bands) by performing
simple text search. In addition to that, analysis of video's tags can give some
more vague overview of user's interests. This kind of data is useful in two
ways: first, it lets easily identify interests for a human, second: it can be
used to verify interests generated with other methods..

In the following sections, we will describe methods used to generate the user
profile. First, we describe our tag counting approach and compare the possible
use of tags and categories in user profiling. Then we will discuss possible
additional information coming from repeating occurrences of the tags in
different sets of videos. The next subsection present the double
nestedness problem, which makes counting tags from subscriptions fundamentally
different that the other two sets. The last subsection describes matching
YouTube videos to actual linked data concepts.

\subsection{Counting YouTube tags and categories}
Analyzing tags information carries some problems. Tags of a single video clip
can be either too numerous, making many
of them irrelevant, too sparse, nonexistent and occasionally just wrong. To avoid
that problem, we aggregate the tags across sets of video clips related to the
profiled user (favourites, subscriptions, uploads). Similar aggregation was
performed for the videos' categories. Below is a comparison of results of counting
tags (chosen by the user) and categories (picked from a small predefined set).

\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}\centering

\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}

\end{tabular}

We can see that category count, even though providing general overview of
person's interests (and the ways she uses youtube), cannot be used to find
specific interests. In other words: we can say that a person is more keen to
favourite music videos or comedy videos after looking at his categories, but in
order to say what kind of music the person prefers, we need more specific
information gathered from (e.g.) tags.

\subsection{How to handle duplicates}

When combining tags collected from various sets of videos, a question should be
asked what preference -- if any -- should be given to tags appearing in more
then one of them. Let's analyze some examples. The letters $f$, $s$ and $u$ mean number
of videos in accordingly: favourites, subscriptions and uploads. The
combinations of letters indicate numbers of tags repeating in these sets.

\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l | l | l | l | l |}
user & $f$ & $s$ & $u$ & $fs$ & $fu$ & $su$ & $fsu$ \\ \hline
politician & 219 & 32321 & 357 & 116 & 59 & 156 & 34 \\
metal music fan & 1103 & 7570 & 73 & 533 & 27 & 44 & 26 \\
one of authors & 687 & 5553 & 10 & 199 & 2 & 2 & 1 \\
\end{tabular}

The tags that appeared in all three sets are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{politician: \emph{wybory, europarlament, czerwca, europa, europejska,
  parlament, 18, unia, europejski, kraków, w, 7, pe, 2009, bogusław, po,
  bezpieczeństwo}}
  \item{metal music fan: \emph{head, death, pantera, for, in, nosturi, the, live, cover, metal}}
  \item{one of authors: \emph{film}}
\end{itemize}

As expected, the repeating tags give much more precise view of person's
interests. Unfortunately, the tags get muted when a user is not active in one of
those areas (e.g. does not upload movies very frequently).

\subsection{The double nestedness problem}
Gathering tags across user's favourites or uploads let us treat the whole video
set as a single document, giving each tag equal weight in the counting process.
Taking a similar approach for subscriptions (e.g. giving equal weight to each
tag of each video of every subscription) leads to some unwanted effects.

Suppose a user subscribes to two channels. One represents the british royal
family (133 uploads), the other one: Apple Inc., an american computer company
(19 uploads). The tags referring to new hardware releases would get flooded with
tags regarding british-specific content. In effect, the user's profile would
depend on third parties' youtube activity which is doubtful to be of any
importance to her.

In order to counteract this effect a number of techniques can be used. One of
them is giving each subscription a weight, based on the number of videos or
total number of tags.

\subsection{Identifying entities in youtube streams}
The user profile information would largely benefit from including data aligned
to existing Linked Data sources. An attempt to run this task trivially for
several types of entities (actors, networks) have been performed. The approach
was to identify actors names by a simple text search in videos' titles and
descriptions. Below are sample results (note that descriptions are not shown):

\begin{verbatim}
Rowan Atkinson LIVE: 02 - Fatal Beatings          , Rowan Atkinson
Yes We Can - Barack Obama Music Video             , Scarlett Johansson
Compay Segundo - Chan Chan                        , Compay Segundo
Drivin' Me Wild - Common Ft Lily Allen [OFFICIAL] , Lily Allen
PT 4 - BRITNEY SPEARS 2006 INTERVIEW BEARS ALL    , Britney Spears
16-Lovestoned Live Futuresex/Loveshow             , Justin Timberlake
15- Cry Me A River Live Futuresex/Loveshow        , Justin Timberlake
Jennifer Lopez - Ain't It Funny                   , Jennifer Lopez
Christina Aguilera - Save Me From Myself [Official, Christina Aguilera
Nancy Sinatra Bang Bang                           , Nancy Sinatra
Eddie Vedder - Hard Sun (Official Video)          , Eddie Vedder
\end{verbatim}

The approach is not ideal. However, above certain threshold of repeats, an
assumption that a user likes a given actor becomes more probable.
